# TAGE-website
Website code (Hosted on AWS)

The website has several interactive elements:
  The main title picture is a slideshow that you can scroll through by clicking on it. 
  The tour date boxes have Google Maps links that you can click on for the location of each show. 
  There is an embedded youtube link for a performance that you can click on to play
  You can expand each playing card by hovering your mouse.
  There the social media logos are links to each band members social media accounts. 


HOW IT WAS MADE:
This is a website I made from scratch to promote my band's last few concerts and to get some experience with basic front end development. 

It includes several media files, the index.html, the style.css and the script.js file that I wrote. 
I created the playing cards and the posters myself using free online tools like Photopea and Canva. 
These files are hosted as a static website on AWS S3. 

As a band, we bought the domain name "thealexgeorgeexperience.com" and I configured the DNS routing to the website with AWS Route 53.
